# Unity List Target Carousel

This is a script i've made for Unity3D, which provides an algorithm for managing a list of targets, by creating an item carousel for it. 
With the item carousel you gain the ability to control items (for example a 4 target camera system, where with a press of the arrows, you swap to the next/previous camera).
